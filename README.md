### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Benedict Alicea. I'm a Senior in high school taking programming classes at a community college.
I am working with Unity and C# to develop two of my own video games by the end of the semester.
I am very new to programming, and I hope to have some projects here by the end of the semester.
